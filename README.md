# Happy Whale Clothing 

Happy Whale Clothing is a Bristol based small, independent business set up by Emily and Victoria, twin nannies. They are my very close friends and I know how much they were talking about getting a website for their little business, but they never got around to look into it. If I can make my first milestone project out of their pictures and build a website for them, then it will go live as soon as I learn more. So it was a deal!
Their only asking was to build something simple and clear, but still represents Happy Whale and its vibrant happy colour scheme. It needed to be simple as it’s a baby clothing website so most of the time tired parents are looking for something cute for their little ones, or might even during or in between nursing. Or perhaps someone is looking for a cute thing for their friend’s newborn, but never in their life they bought a baby clothing item, so they need that extra help. So it needed to be something easy to navigate.

## Who is it for?

### My website is for busy parents:
- Able to navigate easily, find categories of clothing, sizes and prints as quick as possible
- Eye catching images, which grab their attention and standing out from the already large market
- An Our Mission section when the shopper can bond with the seller and can feel their passion about ethical clothing plastic pollution
- Large images, easy to press buttons to add to baskets or select different prints or sizes for quicker checkout
- Easy to approach communications, where the seller not just giving the opportunity to people to directly message them, but also encourages users to upload their pictures of their babies and take pride in the already large and existing social media platforms
- A clear and accurate size guide when parents can take measurements but also giving the chance to send their own size requests
- Log ina and log out from their account
- Add to baske, update and remove, following CRUD and creat a profile for the users where they access their previouse orders as well
- Secure check out via Stripe



### The website is also for people who would shop baby clothes as a present:
Gift Card option offering and displayed on home page
This features are largely displayed through the website, without overloading the users with massive amounts of information, or large amounts of clickable buttons. 
Environment just as comfort of the clothes are very important for the seller and made sure it is displayed in several sections through the website

### Header

#### Navbar:

Sticked to the top of the page includes four links to the rest of the website with the logo. Also there is a basket which displays the number of items in the cart. Next to it there is a user icon where the vistor of the site can Register, Sign IN, Or if they are sign in can view their Account or Log Out. Also there is a surch bar where the customer can search for items by entering keywords, which are return with either of the ites's name or the keyword in the discription of the item. 


### Home page
#### Carousel Slide:

This feature is to grab people attention and to display the latest prints and specials on the website. This is the first thing that the user sees, it is important to be eye catching. The max-width of the carousel is 1300px and the height is auto, otherwise with the full width the images would be too high to fit a full screen comfortably. 

#### Shop by category

This is a quick access to the shop category page, when the customer didn’t use the navbar, or scrolled through the home page first. Images are responsive and displayed full width of the site either in a row of 6, 3 or 2. Hover scales images by 1.05. 

#### Our story

This section introduces the owner of the business and talks about the connection with children's clothes. The second part of the section talks about their mission and passion about plastic pollution and about the charity donation after each sale.  
The whale background image is the connection with the brand and mission, that is overlaid with a dark opacity for better readability. 


### Shop page

#### Side wide alert

A picture montage and a soft fabric section, that explains the sustainably sourced, eco friendly, soft material. This sits on the top of the page, with an image on the left and a responsive background image on the right 

### Shopping Items

This section Shop all: displayes all products that are avilable from the webiste. 

The shop item by category is actually takes the user to the specific items, which are also linked to the 'shop" page url but in the url also displayes the category name.

About Us, Customer info collapses into accordion, Follow us and Sign Up for Our Newsletter are displayed in both views.

## Manual testing
The website was tested all the way through, using Chrome dev tools, and made sure each section displays well in different device sizes. Also regularly run through Lighthouse both on Mobile and Desktop testing. 

- Navar: all navigations bring user to the correct page of the site 
- Our mission: Several set up have been tested and different images and different codes to be  able to display the text over the image in a readable format. Probably this was the longest I spent on an image as I needed a longer research on how to display the image under a text. From several tutorials and videos I found the most useful Kevin Powell and Roberto Mattheus videos. But later on found much easier ways to use opacity on an image without affecting the text above it. 
- Our service section : was tested several times and has been changed and resized.
- Shop page both image and background image was changed several times and was resized to be able to find the perfect background which also fits into the color scheme.
- Gift Card section: several different background colours and sizes were tested.
- Shop items images and row items: font size was tested several times and pricing and reviews were added to the card
