                    <p>
                        Established in 2018 and run by identical twins Emily and Victoria Bradley. Happy Whale is a small UK business which specialises in children's clothing aged 0-6 years. We have designed a range of
                        comfortable, easy wear clothing that is practical and perfect for your little ones as they grow. Having worked as nannies for over 10 years we understand the need for durable clothes that are also
                        stylish too. We use only the highest quality fabrics which are incredibly kind and comfortable for babies and toddlers. All of our clothing is machine washable.
                    </p>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <p>
                        Our recent travels motivated us to create a company that not only makes contemporary, ethical clothing but will help towards saving our precious planet too. Plastic pollution in the worldâ€™s oceans is
                        one of the biggest environmental issues of our time. Therefore, for every sale a donation will be made to the Marine Conservation Society, helping to keep our marine animals and whales happy for the
                        foreseeable future. We really hope you like what we do as much as we enjoy making it. x
